# Getting started with Rust

Rust is an incredibly powerful language once you get the hang of it, but it isn't an easy language to get started with. Here are some resources that I've found useful when getting into Rust. 

TODO: make these links
 
- The [Tour of Rust](https://tourofrust.com/) serves as an easy introduction to Rust and its concepts.
- The [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) is a pretty good crash course for getting into Rust, and I'd highly recommend reading all the way through the book as a beginner to Rust, regardless of your prior programming experience.
- The [Rustonomicon](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/) gets into pretty advanced Rust stuff and unsafe code. You probably don't need to read this all the way through as a beginner, but I'd recommend at least skimming it once or twice since it serves as a useful reference when needed.

> *I've tried to learn Rust multiple times, but gave up quickly and got frustrated when things didn't make sense. I finally committed to actually learning Rust when we decided to use it for Hack as a Service. To get the hang of things, I went through the Tour of Rust first, then I went through the official Rust Book. The official book is really good, but it was really hard for me to get a grasp of those initial concepts, especially coming from a web development background. Going through the Tour of Rust first helped me to get the basics and get a bit familiar with Rust's memory model, and I was able to go into the Rust Book a bit more confidently this time with some background knowledge. #rust and #code are also super helpful - there's a lot of people willing to help you, you just have to ask :)*
